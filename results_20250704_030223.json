    "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nThis isn’t marketing, cause I’m not selling anything yet, but I thought I’d talk about phones and ask y’all how your phone stuff is.\n\nI am currently stuck in America again due to money problems but I’ve been nomading for about 2 years, spent in various cities in Japan. I found work again and I’m taking off as soon as I can.\n\nWhile I was in Japan I was on Google Fi which is a TERRIBLE choice unless you’re doing short term travel and coming back to the United States on a regular basis. I ended up paying basically $70 a month for pay-as-you-go international SMS and phone minutes, with a US phone number that was absolutely useless in Japan.\n\nGetting a local number was possible but I never bothered and I used travel eSIMs the whole time. These functioned, but, the data wasn’t exactly cheap and I was stuck on 4G and heavily throttled.\n\nI am guessing a lot of nomads who only stay in a place for a few months never even bother getting a number where they are staying. And I had this happen time and time again: I’d want to sign up for a local service and they wouldn’t accept a foreign number for registration. Or I would try to ask someone on a date, they’d ask for my number and I’d say “uuuuh do you have WhatsApp? LINE?” And they’d look at the floor, remembering they were talking to someone without residency.\n\nI want to solve this problem with computers. VOIP specifically.\n\nWhat I need is:\n\n* international data roaming, pay as you go, affordable prices, with NO THROTTLE EVER\n* I want a number in my home country so I can talk to my family, bank, and the government\n* I want a local number anywhere I travel, automatically provisioned when I touch down. I can keep it if I want.\n* Reliable incoming calls and good call quality\n* reliable SMS\n\nIf you had a magic wand, what features would your perfect phone service give you?",

There are so many providers out there, and some of the well-reviewed ones don’t seem to allow multiple destination choices.\n\n\n\nHas anyone here used an iPhone eSIM while traveling across several countries in Europe? I’ll look into any brand you mention. Thanks in advance!\n\n",

    "content": "After nearly 5 years of travel without major issues, it finally happened. I lost my phone in Vietnam yesterday. Not stolen (as far as I know hahaha), just gone. I think it slipped out of my pocket while I was riding a Grab bike in Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nIt’s one of those moments that hits hard because literally everything was on there (maps, photos, translation apps, banking access, etc.) Luckily, I had my SIM card backed up to eSIM and was able to get a replacement phone today, but it’s been a stressful 24 hours.\n\nHas this happened to anyone else?  \nHow do you deal with losing such a critical device?  \nAny hacks for minimizing the chaos if it happens again?\n\nAlso curious — do most people carry backups of critical apps or documents in case their phone vanishes mid-trip?",

I always make sure to have backups of critical apps and documents just in case, and I found having a global SIM card like BNESIM really helpful for situations like this when I was traveling. Hope you're able to recover or replace everything you lost!"
