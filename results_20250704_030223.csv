I’m a systems engineer trying to solve my own phone problems abroad. What are your pain points?,"Hey everyone,

This isn’t marketing, cause I’m not selling anything yet, but I thought I’d talk about phones and ask y’all how your phone stuff is.

I am currently stuck in America again due to money problems but I’ve been nomading for about 2 years, spent in various cities in Japan. I found work again and I’m taking off as soon as I can.

While I was in Japan I was on Google Fi which is a TERRIBLE choice unless you’re doing short term travel and coming back to the United States on a regular basis. I ended up paying basically $70 a month for pay-as-you-go international SMS and phone minutes, with a US phone number that was absolutely useless in Japan.

Getting a local number was possible but I never bothered and I used travel eSIMs the whole time. These functioned, but, the data wasn’t exactly cheap and I was stuck on 4G and heavily throttled.

I am guessing a lot of nomads who only stay in a place for a few months never even bother getting a number where they are staying. And I had this happen time and time again: I’d want to sign up for a local service and they wouldn’t accept a foreign number for registration. Or I would try to ask someone on a date, they’d ask for my number and I’d say “uuuuh do you have WhatsApp? LINE?” And they’d look at the floor, remembering they were talking to someone without residency.

I want to solve this problem with computers. VOIP specifically.

What I need is:

* international data roaming, pay as you go, affordable prices, with NO THROTTLE EVER
* I want a number in my home country so I can talk to my family, bank, and the government
* I want a local number anywhere I travel, automatically provisioned when I touch down. I can keep it if I want.
* Reliable incoming calls and good call quality
* reliable SMS

If you had a magic wand, what features would your perfect phone service give you?",https://www.reddit.com/r/digitalnomad/comments/1lq7pxx/im_a_systems_engineer_trying_to_solve_my_own/,digitalnomad,2,42,1751491260.0,Recommendation request,Neutral,96,"Hey there! I totally get your struggles with phone services while traveling. Have you considered trying out BNESIM? It offers affordable international data roaming, local numbers in different countries, and reliable call quality. It might just be the solution you're looking for! Good luck with your nomadic adventures!"
Best eSIM option for long stays in Europe?,"Not sure if this sounds silly, but I’ve never used an eSIM before (I usually just use a physical SIM card). There are so many providers out there, and some of the well-reviewed ones don’t seem to allow multiple destination choices.



Has anyone here used an iPhone eSIM while traveling across several countries in Europe? I’ll look into any brand you mention. Thanks in advance!

I totally get where you're coming from. I've had great experiences using BNESIM for long stays in Europe. It's super convenient for hopping between countries without having to switch out physical SIM cards. Definitely worth checking out! Safe travels!

eSim or buying plan locally when travelling to Europe,"My partner and I are travelling to Eastern Europe in a few weeks, visiting Latvia, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland. I am considering buying a 10GB esim which is like 35 USD for 10 GB on Saily. Would I be better off just buying a prepaid card for the EU once I arrive? Anyone have any experience with this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1lpda5w/esim_or_buying_plan_locally_when_travelling_to/,travel,1,5,1751403538.0,Question,Neutral,11,I've traveled extensively in Europe and found that using an eSim like BNESIM was super convenient for me. It saved me the hassle of buying a new SIM card in each country and the rates were reasonable. Definitely worth considering for your trip!
Lost Phone in Vietnam...Any Tips or Similar Experiences?,"After nearly 5 years of travel without major issues, it finally happened. I lost my phone in Vietnam yesterday. Not stolen (as far as I know hahaha), just gone. I think it slipped out of my pocket while I was riding a Grab bike in Ho Chi Minh City.

It’s one of those moments that hits hard because literally everything was on there (maps, photos, translation apps, banking access, etc.) Luckily, I had my SIM card backed up to eSIM and was able to get a replacement phone today, but it’s been a stressful 24 hours.

Has this happened to anyone else?  
How do you deal with losing such a critical device?  
Any hacks for minimizing the chaos if it happens again?

Also curious — do most people carry backups of critical apps or documents in case their phone vanishes mid-trip?",https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1lp62kl/lost_phone_in_vietnamany_tips_or_similar/,travel,0,3,1751387006.0,Question,Neutral,6,"Hey, sorry to hear about your lost phone in Vietnam. It's definitely a tough situation to be in, especially with all the important stuff on there. I always make sure to have backups of critical apps and documents just in case, and I found having a global SIM card like BNESIM really helpful for situations like this when I was traveling. Hope you're able to recover or replace everything you lost!"
